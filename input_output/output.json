{"input": ["\n       Implantable electrodes are predominantly made from rigid metals that are electrically conductive by nature. But over time, metals can aggravate tissues, \n       causing scarring and inflammation that in turn can degrade an implant's performance.\n       \n       Now, MIT engineers have developed a metal-free, Jell-O-like material that is as soft and tough as biological tissue and can conduct electricity similarly to \n       conventional metals. The material can be made into a printable ink, which the researchers patterned into flexible, rubbery electrodes. The new material, which is a \n       type of high-performance conducting polymer hydrogel, may one day replace metals as functional, gel-based electrodes, with the look and feel of biological tissue.\n       "], "data": [{"id": "0", "primary_language": {"name": "English", "confidence_score": 1.0}}]}
